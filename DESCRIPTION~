Description: Reconstruction of cancer regulatory networks generated using DGTAC (Xu, Forbes et al 2022) and TF-footprinting. Identification of key TFs and patient clusters from a set of networks (n>=15) followed by identification of representative cell lines of those patient clusters. Using those representative cells lines we subsequently identify therapeutic target genes and drugs targeting those genes.
